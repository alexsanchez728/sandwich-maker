# NSS Exercise: sandwich-maker

## Project Description:
> Create a sandwich order form that allows the user to select all the ingredients for a custom deli sandwich. Create a Sandwich module, then create the following as individual modules, using IIFE syntax, to augment Sandwich:
>
> * bread
> * meat
> * cheese
> * condiments
> * veggies

## Project Requirements Included:
* Use Bootstrap
* A section of options for each sandwich part
* The ability to select multiple, or zero, choices for each section 
* An empty DOM element into which the final sandwich order and its cost will be inserted


## Final Product

Using javascript and the IIFE syntax this project's focus was placed on introducing us the students to the idea of using seperate modules for different functions in our projects. This in the long term is better for when any revisions need to happen or when handing code off to others. Modules make it more clear what code stays where in a project.

## How to Run it
Must have Node installed first
```
$ git clone https://github.com/alexsanchez728/sandwich-maker
$ cd sandwich-maker
$ npm install http-server -g
$ http-server -p 8080
